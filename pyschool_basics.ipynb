    "* *Booleans* are your typical small-minded fellows, trying to classify everything as either `True` or `False`. Whenever you use either of these keywords in your code, you'll get a boolean.\n",
    "* *Strings* are what you use to represent text. Whenever your wrap some text in quotes (either single or double quotes), you'll get a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each value type, there is a keyword, which can be used for checking a value's type or for converting a value to another type.\n",
    "\n",

For now, just don't use it for anything else than type checks and you'll be good.\n",

    "Let's imagine the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're a spy in a secret society, all members of which greet each other with the phrase \"May the great windmill smile onto your ancestors!\". However, you're looking for a contact person named \"Alfonso\", that you need to tell the following secret: \"The cake is a lie\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably guessed it by now: You're going to implement that scenario in code. Everytime you 'encounter' someone, who is not called \"Alfonso\", you need to greet him/her with the greeting phrase, otherwise you need to tell him the secret phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve that kind of behaviour, you need something called \"control structures\" - these are means to control which code will be executed based on some condition. Introducing...\n",
    "\n",
    "### `if` ... `elif` ... `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` expression allows you to *only* execute a block of code, if some condition is met. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if 2 + 2 == 5:\n",
    "  message = \"Math is broken! Physics will collapse! The end is nigh!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will only assign the message variable with that string, if `2 + 2 == 5` evaluates to true (which admittedly is very unlikely to happen at any point, but hey - it's an example).\n",
    "\n",
    "That's already very handy, however, you'll often find yourself in situations, where you need to take different actions in more than one case. One solution is, to just define another if statement. But, if the conditions for these cases are mutually exclusive (if one is true, another can't be), there's an easier way.\n",
    "\n",
    "if you have one condition,\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "\n",
    "if 2 + 2 == 5:\n",
    "  message = \"Math is broken! Physics will collapse! The end is nigh!\"\n",
    "elif problem_count == 99:\n",
    "  message = \"I got 99 problems, but Math ain't one.\"\n",
    "else:\n",
    "  message = \"Math is working fine. Walk on, nothing to see here!\"\n",
